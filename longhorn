loghorn replica scehdule issue even though disk space available -

There are 2 conditions that must be met to successfully schedule a replica to a disk:
  The actual space usage condition: (Storage Available - Actual Size) > (Storage Maximum * Minimal Available Percentage)/100)
  The scheduling space condition: (Size + Storage Scheduled) <= ((Storage Maximum - Storage Reserved)* Over Provisioning Percentage / 100)


Storage Minimal Available Percentage:- The default value for Storage Minimal Available Percentage in Longhorn is typically 25%. ( if 100G disk, then 75G will be allocated)
  Actual Size of a volume refers to the real disk space currently used by that volume on the underlying storage. 
  This is different from the Allocated Size or Requested Size, which is the total capacity the volume can grow to.

Example:
  If we create a 10Gi volume but only write 2Gi of data to it:
  
  Allocated Size = 10Gi
  Actual Size = ~2Gi (plus metadata and snapshot overhead)

Storage Available - ( storage max - ( storage reserved + storage scheduled))
Actual Size - Acutual data written
Storage Maximum - is size of disk on server
