loghorn replica scehdule issue even though disk space available - 

Note - In single node cluster even though replica count sets to 3, it will not create replicas on same node.

There are 2 conditions that must be met to schedule a replica to a disk successfully:
  The actual space usage condition: (Storage Available - Actual Size) > (Storage Maximum * Minimal Available Percentage)/100)
  The scheduling space condition: (Size + Storage Scheduled) <= ((Storage Maximum - Storage Reserved)* Over Provisioning Percentage / 100)


Storage Minimal Available Percentage:- The default value for Storage Minimal Available Percentage in Longhorn is typically 25%. ( if 100G disk, then 75G will be allocated)
  Actual Size of a volume refers to the real disk space currently used by that volume on the underlying storage. 
  This is different from the Allocated Size or Requested Size, which is the total capacity the volume can grow to.

Example:
  If we create a 10Gi volume but only write 2Gi of data to it:
  
  Allocated Size = 10Gi
  Actual Size = ~2Gi (plus metadata and snapshot overhead)
1. 
  Storage Available - ( storage max - ( storage reserved + storage scheduled))
  Actual Size - Acutual data written
  Minimal Available Percentage - 25% by default
  Storage Maximum - is size of disk on server
 
2.
  size -  provisioned capacity of the volume, maximum size the volume can grow to. volume’s spec when we create it (e.g., 10Gi, 50Gi, etc.).
  Storage Scheduled - sum of the sizes of all volume. ( if 3 volume with 10G each then the storage scheduled will be 30G) 
  Storage Reserved - Storage Max * (100 - Minimal Available Percentage)% [ if storage max is 100G and minimal availabe percentage is 25%, then storage reserved will be 75G)
  Over Provisioning Percentage
Example :- 
Storage Available - 85.84
Actual Size - 416M
Storage Maximum - 150G
Minimal Available Percentage - 25G
Size - 5G
Storage Scheduled - 19G
Storage Reserved - 45G
Over Provisioning Percentage - 100%

Storage Available−Actual Size>Minimal Available Threshold
 
85.84 − 0.416 > 37.5
