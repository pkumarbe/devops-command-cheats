| **Pod Type**                 | **Runs As**     | **Purpose / Use**                                        |
| ---------------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **csi-attacher**             | Deployment (HA) | Attaches and detaches Longhorn volumes to nodes          |
| **csi-provisioner**          | Deployment (HA) | Creates volumes when a PVC is created                    |
| **csi-resizer**              | Deployment (HA) | Expands volume size when PVC is resized                  |
| **csi-snapshotter**          | Deployment (HA) | Manages volume snapshots and restores                    |
| **longhorn-csi-plugin**      | DaemonSet       | Mounts/unmounts volumes on each worker node              |
| **longhorn-manager**         | DaemonSet       | Core controller: manages nodes, disks, replicas, volumes |
| **instance-manager**         | Per-node pod    | Runs volume engines and replica processes                |
| **engine-image**             | DaemonSet       | Ensures Longhorn engine binaries are available on nodes  |
| **longhorn-driver-deployer** | Deployment      | Deploys and manages CSI components                       |
| **longhorn-ui**              | Deployment      | Web UI for Longhorn management                           |

One-Line Mental Model

CSI pods talk to Kubernetes
Longhorn manager controls storage logic
Instance & engine pods run actual volume processes
CSI plugin mounts volumes on nodes
UI is only for visibility

Which Pods Are Critical?

🚨 Cluster won’t work if these fail:

longhorn-manager

instance-manager

longhorn-csi-plugin

⚠️ Controllers can restart safely:

csi-*

longhorn-ui

driver-deployer
